# Dashboard Project

Inspired by a recent hackathon project I participated in. This is an extension of that project.

### Overview/Purpose

The main purpose of this project was to see if I could complete a recent hackathon project I participated in by myself (entirely from scratch within the same time constraints i.e. 3 hours). I was unable to complete it all within 3 hours. However I did get a majority of the original Hackathon MVP done within 3 hours (consisting of general scss/css, logic for codewars fetching, logic for github fetching and displaying this information using Context API for state handling). Now I work on this project to improve it and "complete" it, so it features testing, is responsive and contains error-handling for usernames being passed in (i.e. if codewars data does not exist for username entered it displays something else, likewise with github data). 

Design

General design below, modified as not needing links and other card types in actual version.
